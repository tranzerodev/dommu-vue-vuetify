      understanding of which mortgage products might be available to you, before

      nearby with similar characteristics combined with local and national
      trends a valuation and confidence level can be obtained.

      When you enter the address of the property you are interested in
      mortgaging, our service provider Hometrack will obtain an automated home
      valuation on that property. Mortgage lenders all uses AVMs and we use the
      AVM used by 12 of the top 15 UK mortgage lenders.
